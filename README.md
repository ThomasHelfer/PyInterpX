# Higher Order Interpolation in 3D for Torch

## Overview
This is a small library that allows a more general interpolation in 3D, using higher order polynomial basis, which Pytorch's [torch.nn.functional.interpolate()](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.ao.nn.quantized.functional.interpolate.html) currently does not offer. 

## Key Features:

Accurate and efficient:
- Achieve high-order polynomial interpolation with exceptional performance using a convolutional network architecture, ensuring precise results for your simulations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before installing TorchGRTL, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager


### License

TorchGRTL is released under the MIT License. See LICENSE for more details.
